Fortville RSS full support - Support configuring hash functions
==================================================================

This document provides test plan for testing the function of Fortville:
Support configuring hash functions.

Prerequisites
-------------

2x IntelÂ® 82599 (Niantic) NICs (2x 10GbE full duplex optical ports per NIC)
1x Fortville_eagle NIC (4x 10G)
1x Fortville_spirit NIC (2x 40G) 
2x Fortville_spirit_single NIC (1x 40G)

The four ports of the 82599 connect to the Fortville_eagle;
The two ports of Fortville_spirit connect to Fortville_spirit_single.
The three kinds of NICs are the target NICs. the connected NICs can send packets
to these three NICs using scapy.

Network Traffic
---------------

The RSS feature is designed to improve networking performance by load balancing
the packets received from a NIC port to multiple NIC RX queues, with each queue
handled by a different logical core.

#1. The receive packet is parsed into the header fields used by the hash
operation (such as IP addresses, TCP port, etc.)

#2. A hash calculation is performed. The Fortville  supports four hash function:
Toeplitz, simple XOR and their Symmetric RSS.

#3. The seven LSBs of the hash result are used as an index into a 128/512 entry
'redirection table'. Each entry provides a 4-bit RSS output index.

#4. There are four cases to test the four hash function.

Test Case:  test_toeplitz
=========================

Testpmd configuration - 16 RX/TX queues per port
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#1. set up testpmd woth fortville NICs::
  
  ./testpmd -c fffff -n %d -- -i --coremask=0xffffe --rxq=16 --txq=16

#2. Reta Configuration.  128 reta entries configuration::

  testpmd command: port config 0 rss reta (hash_index,queue_id)

#3. PMD fwd only receive the packets::

  testpmd command: set fwd rxonly

#4. rss recived package type configuration two received packet types configuration::

  testpmd command: port config 0 rss ip/udp

#5. verbose configuration::

  testpmd command: set verbose 8

#6. set hash functions, can choose symmetric or not, chosse port and packet type::

  set_hash_function 0 toeplitz

#7. start packet receive::

  testpmd command: start

tester Configuration
--------------------

#1. set up scapy

#2. send packets with different type ipv4/ipv4 with tcp/ipv4 with udp/
    ipv6/ipv6 with tcp/ipv6 with udp::

    sendp([Ether(dst="90:e2:ba:36:99:3c")/IP(src="192.168.0.4", dst="192.168.0.5")], iface="eth3")

test result
-----------

The testpmd will print the hash value and actual queue of every packet.

#1. Calaute the queue id: hash value%128or512, then refer to teh redirection table
    to get the theoretical queue id.

#2. Compare the theoretical queue id with the actual queue id.


Test Case:  test_toeplitz_symmetric
===================================

The same with the above steps, pay attention to "set hash function", should use::

  set_hash_function 0 toeplitz
  set_sym_hash_ena_per_port 0 enable
  set_sym_hash_ena_per_pctype 0 35 enable

And send packets with the same flow in different direction::

  sendp([Ether(dst="90:e2:ba:36:99:3c")/IP(src="192.168.0.4", dst="192.168.0.5")], iface="eth3")
  sendp([Ether(dst="90:e2:ba:36:99:3c")/IP(src="192.168.0.5", dst="192.168.0.4")], iface="eth3")

And the hash value and queue should be the same for these two flow .

Test Case:  test_simple
=======================

The same as the above two test cases. Just pay attention to set the hash function to "simple xor"

Test Case:  test_simple_symmetric
=================================

The same as the above two test cases. Just pay attention to set the hash function to "simple xor"

Test Case:  test_dynamic_rss_bond_config
========================================
This case test bond slaves will auto sync rss hash config, it only support by fortville.

#1. set up testpmd woth fortville NICs::
./testpmd -c f -n 4 -- -i --portmask 0x3 --txqflags=0
#2 creat bond device with mode 3::
 create bonded device 3 0
#3 add slave to bond device::
 add bonding slave 0 2
 add bonding slave 1 2
#4 get default hash algorithm on slave::
 get_hash_global_config 0
 get_hash_global_config 1
#5 set hash algorithm on slave 0::
 set_hash_global_config 0 simple_xor ipv4-other enable
#6 get hash algorithm on slave 0 and 1::
 get_hash_global_config 0
 get_hash_global_config 1
#7 check slave 0 and 1 use same hash algorithm
